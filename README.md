# zig-turret

A 2D gunner turret defense game I made in order to learn zig. For the graphics and audio I used raylib.


## Demo

Insert gif or link to demo


## Deployment

If you wish to build the binaries yourself, install zig and then run the build script using ``zig build run`` from within the top folder.
